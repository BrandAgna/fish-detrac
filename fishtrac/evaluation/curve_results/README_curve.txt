The Precision-Recall curve is generated by tuning the threshold (i.e., 0:0.05:1) of an detector to generate different precision and recall values.
In the Precision-Recall result file, the first column is for recall and the second column is for precision.
The raw result is interpolated linearly with the step 0.0001 to calculate the corresponding AP score.
