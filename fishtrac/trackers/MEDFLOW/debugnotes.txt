inside box only (or small border around?)
aspect ratio of box changed = maybe a new box came in???
color creeping in wrong direction = explodes towards 130
	trying with out updating color...  totally exploded
	scale down thresh such that more inside than outside on both images
		if unable, return cannot find fish
		
		
**don't switch to new box if previously tracking with method and < 0.5 conf!!!!****
	-- already done, should be sticking with new one (may need to change later)

selected backup box, caused by  finding just one lone pixel
	lone pixel causes totally unreasonable moves which is rejected (good)
	rejected causes us to pick a backup box, loses track of center (bad)
	
when looking at past boxes, looked for one that is either:
	(a) a color box
	(b) > 0.5
